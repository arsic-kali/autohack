Hey autohack users, hope you enjoy it!

To install and use autohack:

1. Clone it | Type: git clone https://github.com/dxrk-kali/autohack.git

2. Make sure you are inside of the new directory installed called 'autohack' | Type: cd autohack

3. Make autohack a .exe |  Type: chmod +x autohack

Hope everyone enjoys the concept of this project. I plan to see how many people like and enjoy the script and I plan to develop it everyday and add new functions.
