Hey new autohack users, hope you enjoy it!

To install and use autohack:

1. Clone it | Type: `git clone --recursive  https://github.com/dxrk-kali/autohack.git`

2. `./run.sh` (You only need to run this file once for installation) 

3. Done! You can run it from anywhere on your machine by typing `autohack` or `ah`! Enjoy!

Hope everyone enjoys the concept of this project. I plan to see how many people like and enjoy the script and I plan to develop it everyday and add new functions. Please report any and all bugs/issues/ideas to the [Discussions](https://github.com/dxrk-kali/autohack/discussions) / [Issues](https://github.com/dxrk-kali/autohack/issues) board.

Hack on!
