# Installation and Setup

Hey new autohack users, hope you enjoy it!

To install and use autohack:

1. Clone it | Type: `git clone --recursive  https://github.com/dxrk-kali/autohack.git`

2. `./run.sh` This script will simply add autohack as an alias so you can execute it from anywhere on your machine, you need to be root to run this script. (You only need to run this file once for installation) 

3. Done! You can run it from anywhere on your machine by typing `autohack` or `ah`! Enjoy!

**It is reccommended you run this tool as root.**

Hope everyone enjoys the concept of this project. I plan to see how many people like and enjoy the script and I plan to develop it everyday and add new functionality. Please report any and all bugs/issues/ideas to the [Discussions](https://github.com/dxrk-kali/autohack/discussions) / [Issues](https://github.com/dxrk-kali/autohack/issues) board.

Hack on!

## Disclaimer

It is highly advised you use kali linux as most of the scripting and development of this tool is under the assumption it is installed on kali.
