Hey new autohack users, hope you enjoy it!

To install and use autohack:

1. Clone it | Type: `git clone https://github.com/dxrk-kali/autohack.git`

2. `./run.sh` (You only need to run this file once for installation and then close your current terminal and open up a new one. This is because otherwise your .bashrc or .zshrc file won't update until you do which means autohack won't work properly until you have restarted your terminal session,so it is reccommended you simply close your current terminal and just open another one and autohack should work)

3. Done! You can run it from anywhere on your machine by typing `autohack`! Enjoy!

Hope everyone enjoys the concept of this project. I plan to see how many people like and enjoy the script and I plan to develop it everyday and add new functions. Please report any and all bugs/issues/ideas to the `Discussions` board.

Hack on!
