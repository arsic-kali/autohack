Hey new autohack users, hope you enjoy it!

To install and use autohack:

1. Clone it | Type: git clone https://github.com/dxrk-kali/autohack.git

2. ./run.sh (ONLY RUN THIS ONCE INITALLY FOR INSTALLATION)

3. Done! You can run it from anywhere on your local machine by typing 'autohack' (need to be root to do so)

Hope everyone enjoys the concept of this project. I plan to see how many people like and enjoy the script and I plan to develop it everyday and add new functions. 
Check out the discussions board if you'd like to leave feeback or talk about anything autohack/hacking related!

Hack on!
