Hey new autohack users, hope you enjoy it!

To install and use autohack:

1. Clone it | Type: git clone https://github.com/dxrk-kali/autohack.git

2. ./run.sh (bugged right now it seems, thats fine! It just means unless you manually add autohack to your $PATH then you can't run it globally, skip this command for now until it is fixed.)

3. Done! You can run it from anywhere on your local machine by typing './autohack' from inside the autohack directory.

Hope everyone enjoys the concept of this project. I plan to see how many people like and enjoy the script and I plan to develop it everyday and add new functions. 
Check out the discussions board if you'd like to leave feeback or talk about anything autohack/hacking related!

Hack on!
