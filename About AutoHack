Hey all,

AutoHack is just a simple script I started making to help save time when hacking, I started with the intent of just keeping the script to myself and using it to help enforce
some of what i was learning at the time. But then i felt like it had potential to maybe become a project similar to the 'Lazy Script'. So I have since decided to release
this project of mine to github so i can recieve feedback, share my work with others, but mainly i'm doing it to help make AutoHack better.

Overall I appreciate any and all support/feedback, I hope autohack proves to be useful. Thank you for your time and patience as I am having to learn most of everything as I go.

Thats all for now!
Sincerely,
            dxrk
